        %h2 Hi there! 
        %p Thank you for visiting my website.
        %p I'm a full stack web developer (I work primarily with Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery). I've loved puzzles and logic since I was a child, and coding for the web allows me to indulge those loves while maintaining a level of creativity that I also value.
        %p I put together this website to complement my resume (which is included here) and my #{ link_to "LinkedIn profile", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolframpant", :target => "_blank" }. Here you can find a bit of information and lots of pictures from various places I've been, projects I've been involved with--basically, selected highlights from my work and personal lives.
        %p <em> The images to the right reflect various passions and themes that have been interwoven in my life and work. Click on an image to see a bit about that theme, and to see highlights that relate to it.</em>
