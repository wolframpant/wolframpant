  name: "Quantum Mechanics",
  description: "Freshman Organic Chemistry was my first real challenge at Yale. In the second or third week, the professor began using Quantum Mechanics as the basis for our work. The intricacies seemed to be beyond me--remember, I was seventeen and prone to underestimating myself!. So it wasn't until the end of the semester, when a subpar grade in the course threatened me, that I simply sat down for a week and taught myself Quantum Mechanics. This was one of the most satisfying moments of college!"

  description: "I spent a summer living in a log cabin in the middle of the Rockies, studying Field Ecology and doing statistics by hand. I'm pretty sure I was the only one in my class who loved the statistics bit . . . on weekends we went hiking and camping. Living so close to the wilderness of the mountains was a privilege that I will always remember."

  name: "Physical Anthropology",
  description: "I discovered Physical Anthropology the second semester of my freshman year at Yale. I had always thought of myself as a scientist, but one who both loved and mistrusted the manifestations of human culture. Here was a way to approach understanding the human race from a scientific perspective, taking into account how the forces of nature, evolution, and biology have determined who we are.  My dissertation examined the role of biology in determining elements of human culture. MACCHU PICCHU"

  name: "Ireland",
  description: "It was my sophomore year in college, and I was looking for something interesting to do for the summer. My answer? Go to the smallest village I could find in Ireland--oh, the romance-- and find some sort of job. My goal was to experience village life, not to make money, so I quickly found a job as a chambermaid. The village was Castletownshend, population 200, and I worked for the Townshends at the Castle. In the evenings I would go to the village pub, drink a few beers (I never did learn to like the stuff), and sing with my new friends. Everyone had a special song they'd sing when it came their turn. Such a lovely thing!")

  name: "Pardes Institute for Jewish Studies",
  description: "In the year immediately after college, I went to Jerusalem to study at a unique institution. At the time, Pardes was one of very few places in the world where men and women could study traditional Jewish texts, in the traditional manner, together. It was here that I learned many things a Western education had failed to instill in me: the ability to actively engage with a text, to challenge it, to take it into my heart. Living in Jerusalem was a challenge, of course, there is always a sense of danger there and an underlying tension, but it was also beautiful. When life cannot be taken for granted, each moment becomes precious.")

  name: "Nepal",
  description: "After my first year of veterinary school, I arranged to go to Nepal and work with Save the Children US. Save the Children had several microloan projects in process with women's groups in remote villages in Ghorka district. The women had agreed to buy and raise goats with their loans, in order to attain a degree of financial independence from their husbands and, of course, to improve their families' lives; it was my job to talk to them, and to evaluate the success of the projects. I spent two months in three villages, interviewing women about their goats, and trying to understand the women's perspectives. It was a fascinating project! Honestly, though, my favorite part was singing and dancing with the villagers. When asked to sing or to dance, my steady reply was 'sure, if you'll sing or dance for me!' We had a wonderful time.")

  name: "Burning Man/DJ Christ Superstar",
  description: "When I was living in San Francisco, I met a man who was involved in setting up a Burning Man artistic project. He and his friends wanted to put on a rave-style version of 'Jesus Christ Superstar.' Great idea--the only problem was, none of them had ever done any theater. So, without a clear idea of what I was getting myself into, I jumped in and offered to stage manage and assist the director, who had only worked in film before. I found myself on the producing team as well. We had such a blast! Since it was Burning Man, pretty much anything went. We incorporated Hebrew chants, Jewish blessings and Shofar blasts, rearranged all of the music, and created a symbol-laden set out of cardboard boxes filled (when we got there) with sand. A minor windstorm in the desert blew out our 2001-style 'monolith', the lighting designer didn't show up until two hours before the show, and some of the chorus preferred not to appear naked wrapped in cellophane as the costume designer wanted, but in the end the play was an enormous hit.")

  name: "London",
  description: "I had written my Master's thesis on medieval tournaments as theatrical events, so when it came time to research my PhD dissertation, I wanted to deepen and expand that project. My idea was to go to England, particularly to the British Library, and to work with original medieval and early Renaissance manuscripts to find descriptions of theatrical tournaments. Henry VIII, in particular, is known to have staged a number of them. I received a grant and invested some of my own money, and spent six joyous months living in London. The research was lovely--I actually was given access to original documents, both at the Museum and at the College of Heraldry! It was also somewhat frustrating: it takes a while to read enough of a six or seven hundred year old manuscript to realize it's just a copy of another one you've already read. Ah, well. In the meantime, I was in London! I lived in Islington, in East London, and explored the city in my nights and weekends off. I saw dozens of plays and dance performances, went to pubs and listened to bands, and just generally enjoyed the energy and vitality of the city. My roommate was Croatian and most of her friends were Serbian or Bosnian, which added a richness to my experience I never would have expected.")

  name: "Master's Thesis",
  description: "I found a footnote in the first year of my MA program referring to the theatricality of medieval tournaments. Well, I couldn't just let that lie, could I? So I looked into it. For a while, it looked like I would have to rely only on secondary sources, primarily sports history books, for my research. Fortunately, I found a manuscript of a thirteenth-century French chivalric romance, and was able to perform a close textual analysis of that work to flesh out my understanding of these events. It's fascinating--a real theatrical representation of a pervading cultural 'text,' the myth and code of chivalry.")

  name: "'The Knight of the Burning Pestle'",
  description: "The Knight of the Burning Pestle' is a comedy, written in 1604. It features a group of players, here to present a play about a merchant. Well, in the middle of the troupe's prologue, two members of the audience jump up and begin to complain. They don't want to see a play about a merchant--they'd rather see one about a knight in shining armor. The players politely point out that they already have a play prepared, and they have no one left over to play a knight. So, the merchants call up their apprentice. He can play the knight, they insist! Now we have onstage the acting troupe; the 'audience members;' and the apprentice. The play about the merchant goes on, and every one in a while the audience members jump in and demand a scene about their knight. The troupe joins in with the apprentice to create a second, interweaving play. I directed 'Knight' in a black box theatre at the University of Colorado. I had a talented and creative cast, and we were certainly all stretched by this challenge! With full staging and a lot of money, I'd have done something completely different; in these circumstances, I was challenged to created three levels of reality/pretense onstage at once with only the physicality of my actors.")

  description: "I have loved science in general and most fields of science in particular since I was a child. In high school I discovered chemistry--what a beautiful pursuit! The piecing together of the puzzle of how the world works. In college, Freshman Organic Chemistry led me to learn the intricacies of Quantum Mechanics. Then, of course, I discovered Physical Anthropology, which led to wildlife biology and eventually to veterinary school in my desire to participate in the relationship between people and the world around us."

  name: "Back to Nature",
  description: "I've always loved being as close to the natural world as possible, both physically and intellectually. I love camping and hiking, both in the summer and in the winter. In fact, I just finally purchased my first pair of snowshoes, which allows me to go out into the wintry woods on a whim without having to plan and rent equipment first! I just love being out there, where people are few, civilization is far behind, and the world rises to greet you. In my various studies, I've approached the relationship between humans and the world around us from an intellectual perspective. Physical anthropology, the study of human evolution, not only involved research on living primates to better understand protohominids, but uses evolutionary theory to hypothesize on how interact with the natural world has impacted human development. And my chief goal for becoming a veterinarian was to serve on the front lines of the relationship between humans and other animals . . . too bad that Western medicine focusses so much on disease rather than health. I was fascinated by the comparative biology, but lost interest when the conversation turned to disease processes."

  name: "Logic and Puzzles",
  description: "This theme could really be combined with the 'Science' theme. Chemistry excited me because it seemed to approach the world as a puzzle. Putting the pieces together felt like a way to fundamentally understand the ways in which the world around me works. My love of math, which I followed up to multivariate calculus in my first semester of college, also belongs to this theme. I do the New York Time crossword puzzle every day; but in computer coding, I've found an active, useful, and creative way to indulge my love of working out puzzles and thinking logically about algorithms.")

  name: "Different Places and Cultures",
  description: "I was going to call this section 'Travel,' but then I realized travel isn't the only way I expose myself to new cultures. My favorite way to travel is to go somewhere new and to engage in something, to do something there. Examples would be my Save the Children work in Nepal; my work as a chambermaid in Castletownshend, Ireland; my study of Jewish traditional tests in Jerusalem, and my research on medieval tournaments in London. I've also moved to new locations in the US several times, to San Francisco from Boston, to Boulder from San Francisco, to Denver from Boulder. The energy in the streets varies so from city to city, from neighborhood to neighborhood, and I simply love to experience that. Interestingly, I found North Dakota in some ways more foreign to me than many of the farther places I've been. People's internal processes seemed different from mine in a profound way.")

  name: "Creative Pursuits",
  description: "When I was three years old, I 'twirled' a baton in a parade. In that moment I knew that performance, that the gathering of people to watch or to hear other people share their talents, was something special. Dancing lessons, piano lessons, gymnastics and ice skating followed. I played the lead in all of my elementary school plays, because the teachers trusted me to memorize my lines, but I discovered at the same age that I didn't have a natural gift for singing. By the time junior high school arrived, and I had to audition for plays, I came to the realization that I also did not have a natural gift of expression. I was disappointed, but not for long--I decided that I wanted to be involved in the process of creating performance, so I invented the concept of stage crew at my camp and at my high school. I built and painted sets, found and created props, and came up with any excuse I could to be present and useful at rehearsals and performances. I also joined my high school's Concert Choir, and--don't ask me how--taught myself to sing on key! By college, I was a stage manager and a director. I took an intensive acting class at the Yale Drama School one summer, and discovered again that performing was not my greatest strength. Sigh. But in my thirties, I joined a marionette troupe. With a puppet in my hands, I became the performer I'd always wanted to be.")
