#WOLFRAMPANT

This Ruby on Rails app is essentially a simple CMS I put together to create my website, [wolframpant.herokuapp.com](wolframpant.herokuapp.com).

Some content is hardcoded, such as the links to my profiles and to my portfolio; other content, such as the images and text for my various interests and highlights, is found in the database and is accessible to a registered user through the app itself.

I used the devise gem to create one user who is enabled to add and to edit content--myself.
